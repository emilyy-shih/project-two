      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis summer has seen more fires, more heat, more
      storms â€” all of it making life increasingly untenable in larger areas of
      the nation.&nbsp Already, droughts regularly threaten food crops across
      the West, while destructive floods inundate towns and fields from the
      Dakotas to Maryland, collapsing dams in Michigan and raising the
      shorelines of the Great Lakes. &nbspFor years, &nbspAmericans have avoided
      confronting these changes in their own backyards. The decisions we make
      about where to live are distorted not just by politics that play down
      climate risks, but also by expensive subsidies and incentives aimed at
      defying nature. In much of the developing world, vulnerable people will
      attempt to flee the emerging perils of global warming, seeking cooler
      temperatures, more fresh water and safety. But here in the United States,
      people have largely gravitated toward environmental danger, building along
      coastlines from New Jersey to Florida and settling across the cloudless
      deserts of the Southwest.

      <button class="accordion">Is it getting warmer everywhere?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Even though the planet is warming overall, some locations can be
          cooling off due to local factors such as increased cloud cover,
          precipitation, and the level of aerosols in the air. Therefore, many
          scientists prefer the term "climate change" to indicate broad changes
          occurring throughout the world.

      <button class="accordion">
        Are there controversies around climate change?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          According to the National Climate Assessment, 97% of scientists agree
          that the world is undoubtedly becoming warmer over the past 50 years.
          However, there may be some disagreeing opinions on the scientific
          method developed by many scientsits, which primarily occur in the peer
          review process.

      <button class="accordion">
        How does climate change affect severe weather?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Climate change can drastically alter an area's atmospheric circulation
          and weather patterns, such as the duration, frequency, and location of
          droughts, floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and other weather extremes.
