      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRising seas and increasingly violent hurricanes
      are making thousands of miles of American shoreline nearly uninhabitable.
      As California burned, Hurricane Laura pounded the Louisiana coast with
      150-mile-an-hour winds, killing at least 25 people; it was the 12th storm
      to form by that point in 2020, another record. Phoenix, meanwhile, endured
      53 days of 110-degree heat — 20 more days than the previous record.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy comparison, &nbspAmericans are richer,
      &nbspoften much richer, &nbspand more insulated from the shocks of climate
      change. They are distanced from the food and water sources they depend on,
      and they are part of a culture that sees every problem as a capable of
      being solved by money. So even as the average flow of the Colorado River —
      the water supply for 40 million Western Americans and the backbone of the
      nation’s vegetable and cattle farming — has declined for most of the last
      33 years, the population of Nevada has doubled.

      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSince Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida in 1992
      — and even as that state has become a global example of the threat of
      sea-level rise — more than 5 million people have moved to Florida’s
      shorelines, driving a historic boom in building and real estate.
