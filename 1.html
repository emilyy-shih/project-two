      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAugust besieged California with a heat unseen in
      generations. A surge in air conditioning broke the state’s electrical
      grid, leaving a population already ravaged by the coronavirus to work
      remotely by the dim light of their cellphones. By mid month, the state had
      recorded possibly the hottest temperature ever measured on earth — 130
      degrees in Death Valley — and an otherworldly storm of lightning had
      cracked open the sky.
    </p>
    <p class="wildfire2">
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe, thousands go bolts
      of electricity exploded down onto withered grasslands and forests, some of
      them already hollowed out by climate-driven infestations of beetles and
      kiln-dried by the worst five-year drought on record.
    </p>
    <p class="wildfire3">Soon, California was on fire.</p>
    <p class="wildfire4">
      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Over the next two weeks, 900 blazes incinerated
      six times as much land as all the state’s 2019 wildfires combines, forcing
      100,000 people from their homes. Three of the largest fires in history
      burned simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. Another
      fire burned just 12 miles from Marin County. Towering plumes of smoke
      billowed from distant hills in all directions and air tankers crisscrossed
      the skies.
